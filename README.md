# EnDec
This simple program was created by me at the very early stage of my Python learning.
And named endec2 as I had endec back then. Now I am resurrecting my 5-year-old repository and going to use strong cryptographic algorithms to create a real encryption decryption script.
Keeping the previous readme as a sign of respect to my 5-year-old curious self.

Previous README.md:
```
endec.py had a easy algorithm to crack encryption,
so in this time i tried to add level of encryption
use level to encrypt more secure as your level is
sometimes level will not work,
next update prohibited level will bw encluded
git clone https://github.com/takrim1999/endec2.git
cd endec2
python3 endec2.py
```
